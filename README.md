# Mathematical-Pattern-Recognition
Pattern Recognition System for Predicting Readmission of Diabetes Systems

## Dataset: Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set
You can download the dataset from the following link:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

The data is stored in a comma separated values file (.csv) with 50 attributes and more than 100k samples. The last attribute is the target, indIcating the days to inpatient readmission:
- " < 30 " if the patient was readmitted in less than 30 days.
- " > 30 " if the patient was readmitted in more than 30 days.
- " No " for no record of readmission.
This problem is then a 3-class classification problem.
More information about the features can be found in a link provided on the dataset description page above, under the section "Attribute Information". More specifically, Table 1 is the most relevant http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/tab1/

The evaluation metric used if the mean F! score calculated from the confusion matrix.
